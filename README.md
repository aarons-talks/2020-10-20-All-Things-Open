My slides and code for All Things Open 2020


# Python v. Go Notes

- Black code formatting - closest thing to go fmt
- mypy type checking (there are others too) = closest thing to static type checks that compilers/static languages give you
- consider showing go test generation
  - maybe to show how much boilerplate tests can have?
  - maybe to show the tooling is great
