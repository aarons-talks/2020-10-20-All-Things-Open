<h2>Strengths and Weaknesses of Go</h2>

TODO: fold into the what go is and what go isn't slides

<p>
    It's a static, compiled language, so you get

    - more compile-time safety
    - efficiency at runtime
    - fewer unit tests than a dynamic scripting language

    you also get:

    - built-in true multicore concurrency
    - very low level control over networking
    - strong backward compat. guarantees
        in the standard library
        "the Go 1.0 promise"

    but:

    - less flexibility with your variables (they are typed, so you're limited in what you can change a var to)
    - define more things up-front (i.e. data types)
    - more verbose in many cases (you have to type the data type before you create data in many cases)

        mything = {"a": "b"}
        mygothing := map[string]string{"A": "B"}
    
    - less high-level networking support out of the box

    for both languages:

    - garbage collector & runtime, so you don't have ABSOLUTE control over how your program is using its hardware
        Go probably won't help your python program if you need "bare metal" performance
